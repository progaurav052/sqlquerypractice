//we will study various methods to delete duplicate data over here 

//duplicacy is in relation with attributes here , it can be with 1 attribute or 1 or more attribute 


--->trick : first identify duplicate + use delete statement 
lets say we have the table 

| id | model | brand | color |

//here we have duplicacy defined by two attribute model_name and brand_name
