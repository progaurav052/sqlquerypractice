//what is the use of window function ??
-->used to write complex queries easily -->kind of shortcut
-->row_number(),rank(),dense_rank() are some examples of window functions

lets says we have the following table 
| emp_id | emp_name | dept_name | salary |

//now we need to add an column to this table which the maximum salary of the table --> we can solve this normally also

//using window function ,analytic function

<---------query1-------------->
    select e.*,   -----> this will add another columns called max_salary
    max(salary) over() as max_salary
    from employee e  

//find the oldest 2 employees of every dept_name
<---------query2-------------->
    select * from(
        select e.*,
        row_number() over(partition by dept_name order by emp_id) as rn
        from employee e) x
    where x.rn < 3

//select top 3 employees with maximum salary in every departement 
<----------query3--------------->
    select * from(
        select e.*,
        row_number() over(partition by dept_name order by emp_id) as rn
        rank() over(partition by dept_name order by salary) as rnk
        dense_rank() over(partition by dept_name order by salary) as dns_rnk
        from employee e) x
    where x.rnk <= 3
